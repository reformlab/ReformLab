# Project Context for AI Agents

_This file contains critical rules and patterns that AI agents must follow when implementing code in this project. Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._

---

## Technology Stack & Versions

- **Python 3.13+** — `target-version = "py313"` (ruff), `python_version = "3.13"` (mypy strict)
- **uv** — package manager, **hatchling** — build backend
- **pyarrow >= 18.0.0** — canonical data type (`pa.Table`), CSV/Parquet I/O
- **pyyaml >= 6.0.2** — YAML template/config loading
- **jsonschema >= 4.23.0** — JSON Schema validation for templates
- **openfisca-core >= 44.0.0** — optional dependency (`[openfisca]` extra); never import outside adapter modules
- **pytest >= 8.3.3, ruff >= 0.15.0, mypy >= 1.19.0** — dev tooling
- **Planned frontend:** React 18+ / TypeScript / Vite / Shadcn/ui / Tailwind v4
- **Planned backend API:** FastAPI + uvicorn
- **Planned deployment:** Kamal 2 on Hetzner CX22

### Version Constraints

- mypy runs in **strict mode** with explicit `ignore_missing_imports` overrides for openfisca, pyarrow, jsonschema, yaml
- OpenFisca is optional — core library must function without it installed

## Critical Implementation Rules

### Python Language Rules

- **Every file starts with** `from __future__ import annotations` — no exceptions
- **Use `if TYPE_CHECKING:` guards** for imports that are only needed for annotations or would create circular dependencies; do the runtime import locally where needed
- **Frozen dataclasses are the default** — all domain types use `@dataclass(frozen=True)`; mutate via `dataclasses.replace()`, never by assignment
- **Protocols, not ABCs** — interfaces are `Protocol` + `@runtime_checkable`; no abstract base classes; structural (duck) typing only
- **Subsystem-specific exceptions** — each module defines its own error hierarchy; never raise bare `Exception` or `ValueError` for domain errors
- **Metadata bags** use `dict[str, Any]` with **stable string-constant keys** defined at module level (e.g., `STEP_EXECUTION_LOG_KEY`)
- **Union syntax** — use `X | None` not `Optional[X]`; use `dict[str, int]` not `Dict[str, int]` (modern generics, no `typing` aliases)
- **`tuple[...]` for immutable sequences** — function parameters and return types that are ordered-and-fixed use `tuple`, not `list`

### Architecture & Framework Rules

- **Adapter isolation is absolute** — only `computation/openfisca_adapter.py` and `openfisca_api_adapter.py` may import OpenFisca; all other code uses the `ComputationAdapter` protocol
- **Step pipeline contract** — steps implement `OrchestratorStep` protocol (`name` + `execute(year, state) -> YearState`); bare callables accepted via `adapt_callable()`; registration via `StepRegistry` with topological sort on `depends_on`
- **Template packs are YAML** — live in `src/reformlab/templates/packs/{policy_type}/`; validated against JSON Schemas in `templates/schema/`; each policy type has its own subpackage with `compute.py` + `compare.py`
- **Data flows through PyArrow** — `PopulationData` (dict of `pa.Table` by entity) → adapter → `ComputationResult` (`pa.Table`) → `YearState.data` → `PanelOutput` (stacked table) → indicators
- **`YearState` is the state token** — passed between steps and years; immutable (frozen dataclass); updated via `replace()`
- **Orchestrator is the core product** — never build custom policy engines, formula compilers, or entity graph engines; OpenFisca handles computation, this project handles orchestration

### Testing Rules

- **Mirror source structure** — `tests/{subsystem}/` matches `src/reformlab/{subsystem}/`; each has `__init__.py` and `conftest.py`
- **Class-based test grouping** — group tests by feature or acceptance criterion (e.g., `TestOrchestratorBasicExecution`); reference story/AC IDs in comments and docstrings
- **Fixtures in conftest.py** — subsystem-specific fixtures per `conftest.py`; build PyArrow tables inline, use `tmp_path` for I/O, golden YAML files in `tests/fixtures/`
- **Direct assertions** — use plain `assert`; no custom assertion helpers; use `pytest.raises(ExceptionClass, match=...)` for errors
- **Test helpers are explicit** — import shared callables from conftest directly (`from tests.orchestrator.conftest import ...`); no hidden magic
- **Golden file tests** — YAML fixtures in `tests/fixtures/templates/`; test load → validate → round-trip cycle
- **MockAdapter for unit tests** — never use real OpenFisca in orchestrator/template/indicator unit tests; `MockAdapter` is the standard test double

### Code Quality & Style Rules

- **ruff** enforces `E`, `F`, `I`, `W` rule sets; `src = ["src"]`; target Python 3.13
- **mypy strict** — all code must pass `mypy --strict`; new modules need `ignore_missing_imports` overrides in `pyproject.toml` only for third-party libs without stubs
- **File naming** — `snake_case.py` throughout; no PascalCase or kebab-case files
- **Class naming** — PascalCase for classes (`OrchestratorStep`, `CarbonTaxParameters`); no suffixes like `Impl` or `Base`
- **Module-level docstrings** — every module has a docstring explaining its role, referencing relevant story/FR
- **Section separators** — use `# ====...====` comment blocks to separate major sections within longer modules (see `step.py`)
- **No wildcard imports** — always import specific names; `from reformlab.orchestrator import Orchestrator, OrchestratorConfig`
- **Logging** — use `logging.getLogger(__name__)`; structured key=value format for parseable log lines (e.g., `year=%d seed=%s event=year_start`)

### Development Workflow Rules

- **Package manager is uv** — use `uv pip install`, `uv run pytest`, etc.; not `pip` directly
- **Test command** — `uv run pytest tests/` (or specific subsystem path)
- **Lint command** — `uv run ruff check src/ tests/` and `uv run mypy src/`
- **Source layout** — `src/reformlab/` is the installable package; `tests/` is separate; `pythonpath = ["src"]` in pytest config
- **Build system** — hatchling with `packages = ["src/reformlab"]`
- **No auto-formatting on save assumed** — agents must produce ruff-compliant code; run `ruff check --fix` if needed

### Critical Don't-Miss Rules

- **Never import OpenFisca outside adapter modules** — this is the single most important architectural boundary; violation couples the entire codebase to one backend
- **All domain types are frozen** — never add a mutable dataclass; if you need mutation, use `dataclasses.replace()` and return a new instance
- **Determinism is non-negotiable** — every run must be reproducible; seeds are explicit, logged in manifests, derived deterministically (`master_seed XOR year`)
- **Data contracts fail loudly** — contract validation at ingestion boundaries is field-level and blocking; never silently coerce or drop data
- **Assumption transparency** — every run produces a manifest (JSON); assumptions, versions, seeds, data hashes are all recorded
- **PyArrow is the canonical data type** — do not use pandas DataFrames in core logic; `pa.Table` is the standard; pandas only at display/export boundaries if needed
- **No custom formula compiler** — environmental policy logic is Python code in template `compute.py` modules, not YAML formula strings or DSLs
- **France/Europe first** — initial scenarios use French policy parameters (EUR, INSEE deciles, French carbon tax rates); European data sources (Eurostat, EU-SILC)

---

## Usage Guidelines

**For AI Agents:**

- Read this file before implementing any code
- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented
- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option
- Update this file if new patterns emerge

**For Humans:**

- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs
- Update when technology stack changes
- Review quarterly for outdated rules
- Remove rules that become obvious over time

# Product Requirements Document - ReformLab

**Author:** Lucas
**Date:** 2026-02-24

## Strategic Direction Update (2026-02-25)

This PRD follows an **OpenFisca-first platform strategy**.

- **OpenFisca is the tax-benefit computation backend**, accessed through a clean adapter interface (`ComputationAdapter`). No custom policy engine, formula compiler, or entity graph engine will be built.
- **The dynamic orchestrator is the core product.** It manages multi-year projections by executing a pluggable step pipeline between yearly OpenFisca computations: vintage transitions, state carry-forward, and (Phase 2) behavioral response adjustments.
- **Open-data-first:** The platform works out of the box with public data (synthetic populations, emission factors). Custom data is optional.
- ReformLab provides the end-to-end environmental policy assessment experience: data preparation, scenario templates, dynamic orchestration with vintage tracking, indicators, governance, and user interfaces.
- The adapter pattern ensures the platform is not locked to OpenFisca — computation backends can be swapped without changing the orchestration layer.
- Endogenous market-clearing and physical system feedback loops are explicitly out of MVP scope.

If a statement elsewhere implies "new core simulation engine replacing OpenFisca," this section supersedes it.

## Executive Summary

ReformLab is an OpenFisca-first policy analysis platform for environmental and distributional assessment. Instead of rebuilding a microsimulation core, it turns OpenFisca outputs plus external data into a single operational workflow: ingest and harmonize data, define environmental policy scenarios, run multi-year projections, track assumptions, and produce decision-ready indicators.

The target users are analysts and researchers already chaining scripts and tools for carbon-tax and subsidy analysis. The product promise is speed and trust: reusable templates, deterministic scenario execution, ten-year projection support through iterative orchestration, and full run provenance. MVP validates the approach with French household carbon-tax and redistribution scenarios while preserving full compatibility with OpenFisca.

Built by a domain expert with AI-assisted execution, the immediate objective is practical: make policy-grade environmental assessment reproducible and fast without waiting for a new engine ecosystem to emerge.

### What Makes This Special

**Speed-to-decision is the core value.** Configure a carbon-tax scenario, run baseline vs reform over multiple years, and get distributional and welfare indicators in minutes instead of weeks of manual stitching.

**OpenFisca-first architecture is the strategic choice.** Reuse mature tax-benefit policy logic, then layer environmental modeling, orchestration, and indicators on top.

**Assumption transparency is built-in, not aspirational.** Every dataset, parameter, scenario, and run configuration is tracked with reproducible manifests.

**Open-data-first adoption remains key.** Synthetic populations and public datasets enable immediate use; restricted microdata is optional.

## Project Classification

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Project Type** | OpenFisca-centered policy analysis product (Python + notebook + no-code UI) |
| **Domain** | Environmental and distributional policy simulation |
| **Complexity** | High — multi-source data engineering, dynamic orchestration, reproducibility governance, multi-persona UX |
| **Project Context** | Greenfield product layer on top of mature open-source core |

## Success Criteria

### User Success

- **Time-to-first-result:** New user installs via pip, runs the carbon tax example, and sees distributional charts in under 30 minutes
- **Complete analysis in a single run:** One command produces welfare effects, fiscal cost, and distributional impact in notebook outputs — ready for analysis without post-processing
- **Full assumption traceability:** Every simulation run produces an immutable manifest documenting all parameters, data sources, and assumptions — reproducibility by default
- **Policy correctness:** Simulation results match known policy outcomes and published benchmarks (e.g., known carbon tax revenue, distributional patterns from academic literature) within defined tolerance

### Business Success

Since ReformLab is an open-source project, "business" success means adoption, credibility, and real-world policy impact.

| Objective | 12-Month Target |
| --- | --- |
| **Government adoption** | At least 1 evaluation team in French/EU public administration actively using the framework |
| **Correctness credibility** | Validation suite covering the carbon tax domain; results independently reproducible |
| **Research adoption** | At least 1 published paper or working paper using ReformLab |
| **Ecosystem seeding** | Carbon tax MVP fully functional with 4-5 redistribution scenario templates |

### Technical Success

- **Deterministic execution:** Identical inputs always produce identical outputs across runs and environments
- **Vectorized performance:** Full population simulation (100k+ households) completes in seconds, not minutes
- **Assumption traceability:** Every simulation run produces an immutable manifest — data sources, parameters, assumptions, engine version — with zero manual documentation effort
- **Open-data default:** Framework is fully functional using only publicly available data; no restricted microdata required for any core workflow

### Measurable Outcomes

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time from install to first meaningful output | < 30 minutes | Tested with new users unfamiliar with the framework |
| Validation benchmark pass rate | 100% on core benchmarks before any public release | Automated test suite against reference datasets |
| Analysis completeness | Single run produces distributional, welfare, and fiscal cost outputs | Automated check on notebook outputs |
| Run manifest generation | 100% of simulation runs produce complete manifests | Automated verification |

## Product Scope

### MVP Strategy & Philosophy

**MVP Approach:** Problem-solving MVP — prove that an OpenFisca-first stack with dedicated product layers can deliver environmental policy assessment faster and with higher reproducibility than ad-hoc tool chains.

**Resource Reality:** Solo developer with AI assistance. Sequence for leverage: avoid rebuilding policy-calculation internals, build only differentiated layers.

**Architectural Bet:** The differentiation is orchestration and product UX, not core tax-benefit computation. OpenFisca integration is first-class from day one.

### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)

**Core User Journeys Supported:**
- Alex (First-Time Installer) — pip install → quickstart notebook → carbon tax charts in 15 minutes
- Sophie (Policy Analyst) — YAML policy definition → scenario comparison → distributional analysis in notebooks
- Marco (Researcher) — Python API → Jupyter workflow → reproducible results via run manifests

**Must-Have Capabilities:**

| # | Capability | Justification |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | OpenFisca Integration Layer | Treat OpenFisca outputs/API as canonical baseline for tax-benefit calculations |
| 2 | Data Ingestion and Harmonization | Ingest OpenFisca outputs, synthetic populations, and environmental datasets into a consistent analytical model |
| 3 | Environmental Policy Template Library | Carbon tax, targeted rebates, subsidy/feebate templates reusable across scenarios |
| 4 | Dynamic Orchestrator | Multi-year (10+ year) iterative simulation runner with explicit yearly state transitions |
| 5 | Vintage Tracking Module | Track cohort/asset vintages (e.g., heating systems, vehicles) through time |
| 6 | Indicator and Analysis Layer | Distributional, welfare, fiscal, and policy-performance indicators |
| 7 | Assumption Logging & Run Manifests | Immutable run-level provenance across datasets, templates, parameters, and code versions |
| 8 | Scenario Registry & Comparison | Versioned baseline/reform scenarios with side-by-side comparison workflows |
| 9 | Python API + Notebook Workflow | Research-grade programmability for advanced users |
| 10 | Early No-Code GUI | Fast scenario setup, launch, and comparison for non-coding policy analysts |

**Explicitly Deferred from MVP:**
- Endogenous market-clearing models
- Physical system feedback loops (energy/climate stock-flow models)
- Full behavioral equilibrium modeling
- Fully automated report authoring pipeline
- Advanced policy-rule authoring beyond template-driven workflows

### Post-MVP Features

**Phase 2 (Growth):**

| Feature | Trigger |
|---------|---------|
| Automated sensitivity sweeps | After MVP scenario flows are stable |
| Replication package export | After run-governance schema is validated with external users |
| Reduced-form behavioral module | After static dynamic loop is benchmarked |
| Additional policy templates | After carbon-tax + subsidy templates are externally piloted |
| GUI expansion | After MVP no-code workflow proves analyst value |
| OpenFisca direct API orchestration hardening | After CSV/Parquet contract is stable in production workflows |
| Calibration engine | After benchmark datasets and acceptance tolerances are finalized |

**Phase 3 (Expansion):**

| Feature | Trigger |
|---------|---------|
| Public-facing web app | Non-technical user access with guardrails |
| Election showcase application | Compare candidate proposals side-by-side |
| Advanced dynamic module | Lifecycle and transition modeling beyond MVP orchestrator |
| Cloud-Scalable Computation | Large Monte Carlo runs |
| Community Template Gallery | Researcher-published reusable model templates |
| Multi-Country Support | Beyond France |
| AI-Assisted Model Building | Interpretation and model construction assistance |

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Technical Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| OpenFisca contract drift (outputs/API changes) | Version-pinned adapters, contract tests, and compatibility matrix by OpenFisca version |
| Dynamic orchestration complexity | Start with deterministic yearly loop + explicit state schema before adding behavioral layers |
| Data harmonization fragility | Canonical schema contracts and validation at every ingestion boundary |

**Market Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Overlap with PolicyEngine positioning | Focus on environmental policy templates, dynamic vintage effects, and analyst workflow governance |
| Researchers don't trust orchestration results | Publish benchmark packs and scenario traceability evidence |
| No adoption beyond creator | Secure one ministry/lab pilot with real policy question and documented outcomes |

**Resource Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Solo development stalls or scope overwhelms | Ruthless Phase 1 focus on 10 must-have capabilities; defer everything else |
| AI-assisted development hits limits on complex architectural decisions | Entity graph and engine architecture designed upfront with clear interfaces; AI assists on implementation, human decides architecture |
| MVP takes too long to reach external validation | Go/no-go checkpoint: at least 1 external user runs carbon tax model before starting Phase 2 |

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: First-Time Installer — "Alex"

**Profile:** Alex is a PhD student in environmental economics at Sciences Po. He's seen ReformLab mentioned in a conference talk and wants to evaluate whether it's worth using for his dissertation on carbon tax incidence. He's comfortable with Python but has never used a microsimulation framework.

**Opening Scene:** Alex finds the PyPI page after a quick search. He's skeptical — he's tried OpenFisca before and gave up after two hours of configuration. He has 30 minutes before his next seminar.

**Rising Action:** `pip install reformlab` works cleanly. He opens the quickstart notebook linked in the README. The first cell loads a pre-configured carbon tax scenario on synthetic French households. He runs it — distributional charts by income decile appear in seconds. He modifies the tax rate from €44/tCO2 to €100/tCO2, re-runs. The charts update. He switches the redistribution scenario from flat dividend to progressive rebate. New charts, new winners/losers table, all in the same notebook.

**Climax:** Alex realizes he just did in 15 minutes what took him three weeks of ad-hoc scripting last semester — and the results come with full methodology documentation he didn't have to write.

**Resolution:** He bookmarks the API docs, forks the carbon tax example into his dissertation project folder, and starts thinking about how to extend the entity model with vehicle ownership data. He's hooked.

**Requirements revealed:** Frictionless pip install, working quickstart example, pre-loaded synthetic data, instant visual output, clear extension path from examples to custom models.

---

### Journey 2: Sophie — Policy Analyst at French Ministry

**Profile:** Sophie works in the evaluation department of the Ministry of Ecological Transition. She evaluates proposed environmental policies and produces briefing-ready analysis. She's comfortable with Python but frustrated by rebuilding infrastructure for every assessment.

**Opening Scene:** Sophie's director asks for a distributional impact assessment of a proposed carbon tax reform with three redistribution options — due in two weeks. Normally this means: pull the latest INSEE data, chain OpenFisca for income effects, write custom scripts for energy consumption, build Excel charts, and manually document methodology. She's done this five times and dreads it.

**Rising Action:** Sophie opens ReformLab, copies the carbon tax template YAML, and adjusts the parameters to match the proposed reform: tax rate, energy categories, exemptions. She defines the three redistribution scenarios as YAML diffs against the baseline. She points the framework at the synthetic French population (already built-in) and runs all three scenarios.

**Climax:** Within an hour, Sophie has distributional impact charts by income decile for all three scenarios, a winners/losers table, and fiscal cost estimates in her notebook workflow. She runs manual parameter variations (for example, tax rate ±20%) by editing YAML and rerunning. The methodology trail is already documented through run manifests.

**Resolution:** The director gets the briefing a week early. When a colleague questions an assumption about energy consumption by income group, Sophie opens the assumption log, shows the exact distributional assumption used, and re-runs with an alternative assumption in five minutes. She becomes the department's go-to person for policy assessment and starts customizing templates for recurring evaluations.

**Requirements revealed:** YAML policy definition with reform-as-diff, multiple scenario comparison, built-in synthetic population, assumption logging via run manifests, assumption swappability, and fast rerun workflow from notebooks.

---

### Journey 3: Marco — Academic Researcher

**Profile:** Marco is a labor and environmental economist. He's estimated energy demand elasticities by income group using French household survey data. Now he needs to show the distributional effect of a carbon tax with progressive redistribution for a journal submission.

**Opening Scene:** Marco has a set of estimated elasticities in a CSV file from his Stata analysis. He needs a microsimulation layer to compute distributional impacts. Last time, he wrote 800 lines of custom NumPy code that took a month, produced results he couldn't easily replicate, and generated a replication package his co-author couldn't run.

**Rising Action:** Marco opens a Jupyter notebook with the ReformLab carbon tax template. He loads the built-in synthetic French population, defines his carbon tax reform in YAML, and — crucially — his elasticities aren't needed for the MVP (behavioral responses are Phase 2). But the static simulation already gives him the mechanical distributional impact. He runs the simulation and gets distributional charts with deterministic run manifests for reproducibility.

**Climax:** Marco shares the YAML configuration, notebook, and run manifest with his co-author. The co-author reruns the analysis in a clean environment and gets matching outputs because assumptions, parameters, and engine context are pinned.

**Resolution:** Marco includes the ReformLab results in his paper's simulation section. When Phase 2 adds replication package export and behavioral responses, he'll use those for journal appendices and elasticity integration. Even the Phase 1 static results are publishable and credible, so he starts planning an energy poverty template contribution.

**Requirements revealed:** Jupyter notebook workflow, Python API, static simulation as credible standalone output, run-manifest-based cross-machine reproducibility, and clear extension points for future behavioral and replication features.

---

### Journey 4: Claire — Engaged Citizen (Vision / Post-MVP)

**Profile:** Claire is a French teacher, 32, politically engaged. She wants to understand how proposed environmental policies would affect her household and others like hers. She doesn't code.

**Opening Scene:** Before municipal or national elections, Claire sees a link shared on social media: "Compare candidates' carbon tax proposals — see who wins, who loses." She clicks through to a web application built on the ReformLab framework.

**Rising Action:** Claire answers a short questionnaire: monthly household income, region, housing type (apartment, gas heating), commuting pattern (15km by car), household composition. The app builds her household profile and runs pre-configured simulations for each candidate's environmental proposal.

**Climax:** Claire sees: "Under Candidate A's carbon tax, your household pays €340/year more in energy costs but receives €420 in carbon dividends — net gain €80. Under Candidate B's approach, you pay €280 more but receive no rebate." She also sees the distributional picture: income decile 1 gains under both proposals, decile 10 loses under both, but the magnitude differs. She switches to "People Like Me" view and sees how households with her profile compare to the national average.

**Resolution:** Claire shares the comparison with friends. She returns before the election with updated proposals. She doesn't know she's using a microsimulation framework — she just knows she finally understands who wins and who loses.

**Requirements revealed (Vision):** Web UI with guided questionnaire, pre-configured policy scenarios, household profile builder, candidate comparison dashboard, "People Like Me" contextual view, accessible non-technical language, social sharing.

# Architecture Decision Document

_Updated 2026-02-25: Legacy custom engine sections removed per Sprint Change Proposal. See sprint-change-proposal-2026-02-25.md._

## Strategic Direction Update (2026-02-25)

### Decision

ReformLab will **not** build a replacement tax-benefit microsimulation core.
OpenFisca is the policy-calculation foundation, accessed through a clean adapter interface. This project builds differentiated layers above it: data preparation, environmental policy orchestration, multi-year projection with vintage tracking, indicators, governance, and user interfaces.

The **dynamic orchestrator is the core product** — not a computation engine.

### Active Scope

- Data ingestion and harmonization (OpenFisca outputs, synthetic population inputs, environmental datasets).
- Scenario/template layer for environmental policies (carbon tax, subsidies, rebates, feebates).
- Step-pluggable dynamic orchestrator for multi-year execution (10+ years) with vintage/cohort tracking.
- Indicator layer (distributional, welfare, fiscal, custom metrics).
- Run governance (manifests, assumption logs, lineage).
- No-code analyst GUI for scenario setup, execution, and comparison.

### Out Of Scope (MVP)

- Reimplementing OpenFisca internals.
- Custom formula compiler or policy engine.
- Endogenous market-clearing/equilibrium simulation.
- Physical system loop simulation (climate/energy stock-flow engines).

## Project Context Analysis (Active Baseline)

### Requirements Overview

**Functional focus (35 FRs):**

- OpenFisca integration and data contracts.
- Environmental scenario templates and batch comparison.
- Dynamic yearly orchestration with vintage tracking.
- Indicator computation and extensibility.
- Governance, reproducibility, and lineage.
- Notebook/API + early no-code GUI workflows.

**Non-functional focus (21 NFRs):**

- Deterministic and reproducible outputs.
- Laptop-scale performance for common workloads.
- Strict data privacy and offline execution.
- Versioned adapter compatibility with OpenFisca.
- CI-enforced quality on adapters, orchestration, and templates.

### Technical Constraints

- Python 3.13+.
- OpenFisca as the core rules engine dependency.
- CSV/Parquet as interoperability contracts.
- Fully offline operation in user environment.
- Single-machine target (16GB laptop) for MVP.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

1. Assumption transparency and manifest lineage across all runs.
2. Deterministic sequencing in multi-year iterative execution.
3. Adapter/version governance for OpenFisca compatibility.
4. Clear data-contract validation at every ingestion boundary.
5. Scenario/template versioning for auditability and collaboration.

## Active Architecture Blueprint

### Core Design Principle

ReformLab does NOT build a policy computation engine. OpenFisca is the tax-benefit computation layer. This project builds everything around it: data preparation, environmental policy orchestration, multi-year projection, vintage tracking, indicators, governance, and user interfaces.

### Layered Architecture

```

│  Computation Adapter Interface                   │
│  └── OpenFiscaAdapter (primary implementation)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Computation Adapter Pattern

The orchestrator never calls OpenFisca directly. All tax-benefit computation goes through a clean adapter interface:

```python
class ComputationAdapter(Protocol):
    """Interface for tax-benefit computation backends."""
    def compute(self, population: PopulationData, policy: PolicyConfig,
                period: int) -> ComputationResult: ...
    def version(self) -> str: ...

class OpenFiscaAdapter(ComputationAdapter):
    """Primary implementation wrapping OpenFisca."""
    ...
```

This allows:
- Swapping OpenFisca for PolicyEngine or other backends in the future
- Mocking the computation layer for orchestrator testing
- Version-pinning OpenFisca without coupling the core codebase

### Step-Pluggable Dynamic Orchestrator

The orchestrator runs a yearly loop (t → t+n) where each year executes a pipeline of pluggable steps:

```
For each year t in [start_year .. end_year]:
  1. Run ComputationAdapter (OpenFisca tax-benefit for year t)
  2. Apply environmental policy templates (carbon tax, subsidies)
  3. Execute transition steps (pluggable pipeline):
     a. Vintage transitions (asset cohort aging, fleet turnover)
     b. State carry-forward (income updates, demographic changes)
     c. [Phase 2: Behavioral response adjustments]
  4. Record year-t results and manifest entry
  5. Feed updated state into year t+1
```

Steps are registered as plugins. Phase 1 ships vintage transitions and state carry-forward. Phase 2 adds behavioral response steps without modifying the orchestrator core.

### Subsystems

1. `computation/`: Adapter interface + OpenFiscaAdapter implementation. Handles CSV/Parquet ingestion of OpenFisca outputs and optional direct API orchestration. Version-pinned contracts.
2. `data/`: Open data ingestion, synthetic population generation, data transformation pipelines. Prepares inputs for the computation adapter.
3. `templates/`: Environmental policy templates (carbon tax, subsidies, rebates, feebates) and scenario registry with versioned definitions.
4. `orchestrator/`: Dynamic yearly loop with step-pluggable pipeline. Manages deterministic sequencing, seed control, and state transitions.
5. `vintage/`: Cohort/vintage state management. Registered as orchestrator step. Tracks asset classes (vehicles, heating) through time.
6. `indicators/`: Distributional, welfare, fiscal, and custom indicator computation. Aggregation by decile, geography, and custom groupings.
7. `governance/`: Run manifests, assumption logs, run lineage, output hashes. Tracks OpenFisca version, adapter version, scenario version.
8. `interfaces/`: Python API, notebook workflows, early no-code GUI.

### Starter & Tooling Decisions

- Scientific Python packaging: `pyproject.toml`, `uv`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`
- CI split: fast adapter/unit tests and slower integration/regression runs
- Coverage focus: adapter contracts, orchestrator determinism, vintage transitions, template correctness
- No custom formula compiler — environmental policy logic is Python code in template modules, not YAML formula strings

### Data Contracts

- Input: OpenFisca outputs (CSV/Parquet), synthetic populations, environmental datasets (emission factors, energy consumption)
- Output: yearly panel datasets, scenario comparison tables, indicator exports
- Contract failures are explicit, field-level, and blocking
- Adapter interface defines the computation contract boundary

### Dynamic Execution Semantics

- Baseline and reform scenarios run over 10+ years.
- Each year is explicit (`t`, `t+1`, ..., `t+n`), with deterministic carry-forward rules.
- Vintage states are updated through registered transition step functions.
- Randomness is seed-controlled and logged in manifests.
- Orchestrator step pipeline is the extension point for Phase 2+ capabilities.

### Reproducibility & Governance

- Every run records: OpenFisca version, adapter version, scenario version, data hashes, seeds, assumptions, step pipeline configuration.
- Cross-machine reproducibility uses documented tolerances where floating point differs.
- Lineage links yearly sub-runs to parent scenario runs.
- Manifests are JSON, machine-readable, Git-diffable.

### Delivery Sequence

1. Computation adapter + OpenFisca integration (simplified EPIC-1).
2. Carbon-tax + subsidy templates with baseline/reform comparison.
3. Dynamic orchestrator (pluggable step pipeline) + vintage module MVP.
4. Indicator layer and manifest lineage hardening.
5. Early no-code GUI workflow for analyst scenario operations.

### Phase 2+ Architecture Extensions

- **Behavioral responses:** New orchestrator step that applies elasticities between yearly computation runs (proven pattern from PolicyEngine).
- **System dynamics bridge:** Aggregate stock-flow outputs derived from microsimulation vintage tracking results.
- **Alternative computation backends:** Swap adapter implementations without changing orchestrator or indicator layers.

## Deployment & GUI Architecture (2026-02-27)

### Deployment Decision

The no-code GUI (EPIC-6) will be a web application with a React/TypeScript frontend and a FastAPI Python backend, deployed on a Hetzner VPS using Kamal 2 (Docker-based deployment tool). The MVP is deployed from day one to enable sharing with colleagues (2-10 users).

### Rationale

- **Same stack for MVP and future phases** — no throwaway prototype. The MVP GUI uses the same React + Shadcn/ui + Tailwind + FastAPI stack specified in the UX design document. Phase 3 (public web app) extends rather than replaces.
- **Hetzner** chosen for: best price/performance in Europe (~3.29 EUR/month for CX22), EU datacenter (Germany), GDPR compliance, not subject to US Cloud Act.
- **Kamal 2** chosen for: zero-downtime Docker deployments via SSH, built-in Traefik reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS, single YAML config file, language-agnostic (works with Python, Node, any Docker image), rollback in one command. Created by DHH (Rails creator), standard in Rails 8, but fully framework-agnostic.
- **Provider-agnostic** — Kamal deploys to any Linux server via SSH. Migrating to a different host (Scaleway, OVH, or a SecNumCloud provider) means changing one IP address in the config.
- **File-based storage works natively** — real persistent disk on the VPS, no need to adapt code for S3/object storage. Standard `open()` / `pd.read_parquet()` calls work as-is.

### Monorepo Structure

```
reformlab/
  src/                        ← Python backend (FastAPI API + core library)
  frontend/                   ← React/TypeScript (Vite + Shadcn/ui + Tailwind)
  tests/
  Dockerfile                  ← Backend container definition
  frontend/Dockerfile         ← Frontend container (nginx serving build)
  config/
    deploy.yml                ← Kamal deployment configuration
  .github/workflows/
    deploy.yml                ← GitHub Actions auto-deploy on push
  .kamal/
    secrets                   ← Encrypted secrets for Kamal
  pyproject.toml
```

Both frontend and backend live in the same repository. Kamal manages both as separate services on the same Hetzner server.

```

### Frontend Stack

As specified in the UX design document:

- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Vite (build tooling)
- Shadcn/ui + Radix UI (component library)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (styling with design tokens)
- Recharts/Nivo (simulation charts)
- React Flow (lineage DAG visualization)
- React Hook Form + Zod (form handling)

Served as a static build by an nginx container. Calls the backend API via HTTPS.

### Backend Stack

- FastAPI (REST API)
- Python 3.13+ (same as core library)
- uvicorn (ASGI server)
- The FastAPI layer exposes the existing Python API (orchestrator, scenarios, indicators, governance) as HTTP endpoints

### Deployment Stack

- **Kamal 2** — Docker-based deployment tool (SSH + Docker, no Kubernetes)
- **Traefik** — reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt HTTPS certificates (managed by Kamal)
- **Docker** — containerization for both frontend and backend
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD trigger on push to master, calls `kamal deploy`
- **GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)** — Docker image storage

### Data Storage (MVP)

File-based, no database:

- **Scenario configs:** YAML/JSON files on server disk (`/data/reformlab/`)
- **Run outputs:** CSV/Parquet on server disk
- **Run manifests:** JSON on server disk
- **Scenario registry:** File-based (already implemented in EPIC-2)

Docker volume mount maps `/data/reformlab` on the host to `/app/data` in the backend container. Data persists across deployments and container restarts. Sufficient for 2-10 users working with open/public data. If multi-user concurrent writes become an issue in Phase 3, migrate to SQLite or PostgreSQL — the file-based contract layer makes this a contained change.

### Authentication (MVP)

Simple shared-password authentication via FastAPI middleware:

- Single shared password stored as a Kamal secret (encrypted in `.kamal/secrets`, injected as environment variable)
- FastAPI middleware checks password on every API request
- Frontend shows a password prompt on first access, stores the token in browser session
- No user accounts, no OAuth, no database — appropriate for 2-10 trusted colleagues

Phase 3 (public web app with Claire persona) will require proper user authentication (OAuth or similar). This is a separate architectural decision at that point.

### Cost Estimate

| Service | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Hetzner CX22 (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 40 GB SSD) | 3.29 EUR |
| Domain name (annual, amortized) | ~1 EUR |
| **Total** | **~4.29 EUR/month** |

### Sovereignty & Compliance Positioning

- Hosted on Hetzner, European provider (Germany), EU datacenter
- GDPR compliant, data stays in EU, no transfer outside EU
- Not subject to US Cloud Act or other extra-territorial legislation
- Application uses exclusively open public data (INSEE, Eurostat, synthetic populations)
- SecNumCloud is not required for open public data under the French "Cloud au Centre" doctrine
- If SecNumCloud becomes required (e.g., restricted microdata handling), Kamal deploys to any Linux server via SSH — migrate by changing the target IP to a SecNumCloud-qualified provider (Scalingo on Outscale `osc-secnum-fr1`, or Clever Cloud on Cloud Temple SecNumCloud zone). Application code unchanged.

### Migration Path to Phase 3

Kamal is provider-agnostic. All migrations below require zero application code changes:

1. **More users / more power:** Upgrade Hetzner server (CX32 at 5.39 EUR, CX42 at 17.49 EUR). Change server spec in Hetzner console, redeploy.
2. **French sovereignty required:** Move to Scaleway or OVH VPS in Paris. Change one IP in `config/deploy.yml`, run `kamal setup && kamal deploy`.
3. **SecNumCloud required:** Deploy to a server on Scalingo/Outscale `osc-secnum-fr1` or Clever Cloud on Cloud Temple SecNumCloud zone. Same Kamal config, different target.
4. **User accounts:** Replace shared-password middleware with OAuth/OIDC. Add user table (SQLite or PostgreSQL).
5. **Horizontal scaling:** Kamal supports multi-server deployment. Add server IPs to `config/deploy.yml` and Kamal load-balances across them via Traefik.

## API Design — FastAPI Server Layer (2026-02-28)

### Design Principle

The FastAPI server is a **thin HTTP facade** over the existing Python API in `src/reformlab/interfaces/api.py`. No business logic lives in the server layer. Every route handler delegates to functions that already work: `run_scenario()`, `create_scenario()`, `list_scenarios()`, `get_scenario()`, `clone_scenario()`, `check_memory_requirements()`, and `SimulationResult` methods (`indicators()`, `export_csv()`, `export_parquet()`).

### Package Structure

```
src/reformlab/server/
├── __init__.py
├── app.py              ← FastAPI app factory (create_app())
├── auth.py             ← Shared-password middleware
├── models.py           ← Pydantic v2 request/response models
├── dependencies.py     ← Dependency injection (adapter, result cache)
└── routes/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── scenarios.py    ← Scenario CRUD
    ├── runs.py         ← Simulation execution
    ├── indicators.py   ← Indicator computation
    ├── exports.py      ← File export/download
    ├── templates.py    ← Template listing
    └── populations.py  ← Population dataset listing
```

### Dependencies

Add as optional extra in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
server = [
    "fastapi>=0.115.0",
    "uvicorn[standard]>=0.34.0",
    "python-multipart>=0.0.9",
]
```

Install with `uv sync --extra server`. Pydantic v2 is already a transitive dependency of FastAPI.

### App Factory

`src/reformlab/server/app.py` exposes `create_app() -> FastAPI`:

```python
def create_app() -> FastAPI:
    app = FastAPI(
        title="ReformLab API",
        version=reformlab.__version__,
        docs_url="/api/docs",
        openapi_url="/api/openapi.json",
    )

    # CORS must be added BEFORE auth middleware
    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=_cors_origins(),  # localhost:5173 + production
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )

    # Auth middleware (skips /api/auth/login and /api/docs)
    app.add_middleware(AuthMiddleware)

    # Register route groups
    app.include_router(auth_router,        prefix="/api/auth")
    app.include_router(scenarios_router,   prefix="/api/scenarios")
    app.include_router(runs_router,        prefix="/api/runs")
    app.include_router(indicators_router,  prefix="/api/indicators")
    app.include_router(exports_router,     prefix="/api/exports")
    app.include_router(templates_router,   prefix="/api/templates")
    app.include_router(populations_router, prefix="/api/populations")

    return app
```

Run with: `uvicorn src.reformlab.server.app:create_app --factory --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`

Dev mode: `uvicorn src.reformlab.server.app:create_app --factory --reload --port 8000`

### Route Contracts

#### Authentication

| Method | Path | Request Body | Response | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | `{ "password": "string" }` | `{ "token": "string" }` | 200 or 401 |

- Password validated against `REFORMLAB_PASSWORD` env var.
- Token is a random hex string stored server-side in a session set.
- Subsequent requests pass token via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- No expiry for MVP. Phase 3 replaces with OAuth/OIDC.

#### Scenarios

| Method | Path | Request Body | Response | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `GET` | `/api/scenarios` | — | `{ "scenarios": ["name1", ...] }` | 200 |
| `GET` | `/api/scenarios/{name}` | — | `ScenarioResponse` | 200 or 404 |
| `POST` | `/api/scenarios` | `CreateScenarioRequest` | `{ "version_id": "string" }` | 201 or 422 |
| `POST` | `/api/scenarios/{name}/clone` | `{ "new_name": "string" }` | `ScenarioResponse` | 201 or 404 |

Delegates to: `list_scenarios()`, `get_scenario(name)`, `create_scenario(scenario, name, register=True)`, `clone_scenario(name, new_name=new_name)`.

#### Simulation Runs

| Method | Path | Request Body | Response | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `POST` | `/api/runs` | `RunRequest` | `RunResponse` | 200 or 422/500 |
| `POST` | `/api/runs/memory-check` | `MemoryCheckRequest` | `MemoryCheckResponse` | 200 |

**Execution model (MVP):** `POST /api/runs` is **synchronous** — it blocks until the simulation completes and returns the full result. This is acceptable because:
- Target run time is <10s for 100k households (NFR1).
- MVP serves 2-10 users, not concurrent load.
- Frontend shows a loading spinner during the request.

**Upgrade path:** If runs exceed 10s, switch to polling: `POST /api/runs` returns `{ "run_id": "..." }` immediately, `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/status` returns progress, `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/result` returns the completed result.

#### Indicators

| Method | Path | Request Body | Response | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `POST` | `/api/indicators/{type}` | `IndicatorRequest` | `IndicatorResponse` | 200 or 422 |
| `POST` | `/api/comparison` | `ComparisonRequest` | `IndicatorResponse` | 200 or 422 |

`{type}` is one of: `distributional`, `geographic`, `welfare`, `fiscal`.

Delegates to: `cached_result.indicators(type, **kwargs)`.

For welfare indicators and comparison, the request must reference both a baseline and reform `run_id` from the result cache.

#### Exports

| Method | Path | Request Body | Response | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `POST` | `/api/exports/csv` | `{ "run_id": "string" }` | `StreamingResponse` (file download) | 200 or 404 |
| `POST` | `/api/exports/parquet` | `{ "run_id": "string" }` | `StreamingResponse` (file download) | 200 or 404 |

Delegates to: `cached_result.export_csv(tmp_path)` and `cached_result.export_parquet(tmp_path)`.

Returns file as `StreamingResponse` with appropriate `Content-Disposition` header.

#### Templates

| Method | Path | Request Body | Response | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `GET` | `/api/templates` | — | `{ "templates": [TemplateListItem, ...] }` | 200 |
| `GET` | `/api/templates/{name}` | — | `TemplateDetailResponse` | 200 or 404 |

Lists available policy templates (carbon tax, subsidy, rebate, feebate) with their default parameters and parameter groups.

#### Populations

| Method | Path | Request Body | Response | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `GET` | `/api/populations` | — | `{ "populations": [PopulationItem, ...] }` | 200 |

Lists available population datasets by scanning the data directory for CSV/Parquet files.

### Pydantic v2 Request/Response Models

All models in `src/reformlab/server/models.py`. Key patterns:

**Frozen dataclass → Pydantic model translation:** The domain layer uses frozen dataclasses (`ScenarioConfig`, `SimulationResult`). The server layer creates parallel Pydantic models for HTTP serialization. Route handlers translate between them.

```python
# Request models

class LoginRequest(BaseModel):
    password: str

class RunRequest(BaseModel):
    template_name: str
    parameters: dict[str, Any]
    start_year: int
    end_year: int
    population_id: str | None = None
    seed: int | None = None
    baseline_id: str | None = None

class MemoryCheckRequest(BaseModel):

    end_year: int
    description: str = ""
    baseline_ref: str | None = None

class CloneRequest(BaseModel):
    new_name: str
```

```python
# Response models

    token: str

class RunResponse(BaseModel):
    run_id: str
    success: bool
    scenario_id: str
    years: list[int]

class IndicatorResponse(BaseModel):

    excluded_count: int

class ScenarioResponse(BaseModel):

    parameters: dict[str, Any]
    year_schedule: dict[str, int]  # {"start_year": N, "end_year": M}
    baseline_ref: str | None = None

class TemplateListItem(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    type: str
    parameter_count: int
    description: str
    parameter_groups: list[str]

class TemplateDetailResponse(TemplateListItem):
    default_parameters: dict[str, Any]

class PopulationItem(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    households: int
    source: str
    year: int

class ErrorResponse(BaseModel):
    error: str
    what: str
    why: str
    fix: str
    status_code: int
```

### Serialization Rules

- **PyArrow `pa.Table` → JSON:** `table.to_pydict()` produces `dict[str, list]`. This is the canonical wire format for panel data and indicator tables.
- **`Path` objects:** Serialize as strings via Pydantic `model_serializer`.
- **`datetime` objects:** Serialize as ISO 8601 strings.
- **Frozen dataclasses:** Converted to Pydantic models at the route handler boundary. No `dataclasses.asdict()` in responses — explicit Pydantic field mapping.

### Result Cache

Simulation results contain large PyArrow tables. Re-serializing on every indicator/export request is wasteful.

```python
class ResultCache:
    """In-memory LRU cache for SimulationResult objects."""

    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 10):
        self._cache: OrderedDict[str, SimulationResult] = OrderedDict()
        self._max_size = max_size

    def store(self, run_id: str, result: SimulationResult) -> None:
        if len(self._cache) >= self._max_size:
            self._cache.popitem(last=False)  # Evict oldest
        self._cache[run_id] = result

    def get(self, run_id: str) -> SimulationResult | None:
        result = self._cache.get(run_id)
        if result is not None:
            self._cache.move_to_end(run_id)  # Mark as recently used
        return result
```

- `POST /api/runs` stores the result under a generated `run_id` (UUID4).
- `POST /api/indicators/{type}` and `POST /api/exports/*` reference `run_id` to retrieve cached results.
- Max 10 entries. LRU eviction. No disk persistence — results are ephemeral across server restarts.

### Dependency Injection

```python
# src/reformlab/server/dependencies.py

# Global singletons (created once in app factory, injected via Depends)
_result_cache = ResultCache(max_size=10)
_adapter: ComputationAdapter | None = None

def get_result_cache() -> ResultCache:
    return _result_cache

def get_adapter() -> ComputationAdapter:
    global _adapter
    if _adapter is None:
        # Initialize default adapter (MockAdapter in dev, OpenFiscaAdapter in prod)
        _adapter = _create_adapter()
    return _adapter
```

Route handlers use `Depends(get_result_cache)` and `Depends(get_adapter)`.

### Authentication Middleware

```python
# src/reformlab/server/auth.py

class AuthMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """Shared-password auth for MVP (2-10 trusted colleagues)."""

    SKIP_PATHS = {"/api/auth/login", "/api/docs", "/api/openapi.json"}

    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        if request.url.path in self.SKIP_PATHS:
            return await call_next(request)

        token = request.headers.get("Authorization", "").removeprefix("Bearer ")
        if not token or token not in _active_sessions:
            return JSONResponse(status_code=401, content={"error": "Unauthorized"})

        return await call_next(request)
```

- `_active_sessions` is a `set[str]` stored in-memory.
- `POST /api/auth/login` validates password against `os.environ["REFORMLAB_PASSWORD"]`, generates a random token via `secrets.token_hex(32)`, adds it to `_active_sessions`, returns it.
- No expiry for MVP. Server restart clears all sessions (users re-enter password).

### Error Mapping

Python API exceptions map to HTTP responses:

| Python Exception | HTTP Status | Error Response |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| `ConfigurationError` | 422 Unprocessable Entity | `{ "error": "Configuration error", "what": field_path, "why": expected vs actual, "fix": guidance }` |
| `ValidationErrors` | 422 Unprocessable Entity | `{ "error": "Validation failed", "what": "N issues found", "why": issues list, "fix": per-issue guidance }` |
| `SimulationError` | 500 Internal Server Error | `{ "error": "Simulation error", "what": message, "why": cause, "fix": guidance }` |
| `RegistryError` | 404 Not Found | `{ "error": "Not found", "what": summary, "why": reason, "fix": guidance }` |
| `MemoryWarning` | 200 (with `should_warn: true`) | Not an error — returned as data in `MemoryCheckResponse` |

Implement via FastAPI exception handlers registered in `create_app()`:

```python
@app.exception_handler(ConfigurationError)
async def configuration_error_handler(request, exc):
    return JSONResponse(status_code=422, content={
        "error": "Configuration error",
        "what": exc.field_path,
        "why": f"Expected {exc.expected}, got {exc.actual!r}",
        "fix": exc.fix or f"Provide a valid {exc.expected}",
        "status_code": 422,
    })
```

### CORS Configuration

```python
def _cors_origins() -> list[str]:
    origins = ["http://localhost:5173"]  # Vite dev server
    extra = os.environ.get("REFORMLAB_CORS_ORIGINS", "")
    if extra:
        origins.extend(o.strip() for o in extra.split(",") if o.strip())
    return origins
```

Production adds `https://app.reformlab.fr` via `REFORMLAB_CORS_ORIGINS` env var.

### Vite Dev Proxy

Add to `frontend/vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
server: {
  proxy: {
    "/api": {
      target: "http://localhost:8000",
      changeOrigin: true,
    },
  },
}
```

Frontend calls `/api/scenarios` (relative) in development. Vite proxies to the FastAPI backend. In production, Traefik routes by subdomain (`api.reformlab.fr` vs `app.reformlab.fr`).

### Data Flow Summary

```
Frontend (React)
    │
    ├─ POST /api/runs { template, params, years }
    │       ↓
    │  RunRequest → ScenarioConfig → run_scenario(config, adapter)
    │       ↓
    │  SimulationResult stored in ResultCache[run_id]
    │       ↓
    │  RunResponse { run_id, success, years, row_count }
    │
    ├─ POST /api/indicators/distributional { run_id }
    │       ↓
    │  ResultCache.get(run_id) → result.indicators("distributional")
    │       ↓
    │  IndicatorResult.to_table().to_pydict() → IndicatorResponse
    │
    ├─ POST /api/comparison { baseline_run_id, reform_run_id }
    │       ↓
    │  baseline = cache.get(baseline_run_id)
    │  reform = cache.get(reform_run_id)
    │  baseline.indicators("welfare", reform_result=reform)
    │       ↓
    │  IndicatorResponse
    │
    └─ POST /api/exports/csv { run_id }
            ↓
        result.export_csv(tmp) → StreamingResponse
```

### Code Quality Standards

- `from __future__ import annotations` at top of every server module.
- Pydantic v2 conventions: `model_validate()`, `model_dump()`, `ConfigDict`.
- `mypy --strict` must pass on all server code.
- `ruff` compliance (E, F, I, W rules).
- No direct OpenFisca imports in server code — adapter protocol only.
- Structured logging with `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

- OpenFiscaAdapter passes contract tests for CSV/Parquet input and output mapping.
- Adapter can be mocked for orchestrator unit testing.
- Open-data pipeline loads synthetic population and emission factor datasets.

- Unsupported OpenFisca version fails with explicit compatibility error.
- Adapter test fixtures run in CI.
- Repository has pyproject.toml with dependency pinning, ruff linting, mypy type checking, and pytest configured.
- CI pipeline runs lint + unit tests on every push.

### Story-Level Acceptance Criteria

**BKL-101: Define ComputationAdapter interface and OpenFiscaAdapter implementation**

- Given an OpenFisca output dataset (CSV or Parquet), when the adapter's `compute()` method is called, then it returns a ComputationResult with mapped output fields.
- Given a mock adapter, when the orchestrator calls `compute()`, then it receives valid results without requiring OpenFisca installed.
- Given an unsupported OpenFisca version, when the adapter is initialized, then it raises an explicit compatibility error with version mismatch details.

**BKL-102: Implement CSV/Parquet ingestion for OpenFisca outputs and population data**

- Given a valid CSV file with OpenFisca household outputs, when ingested through the adapter, then population data is loaded into the internal schema with correct types.
- Given a valid Parquet file, when ingested, then results match CSV ingestion for the same data.
- Given a CSV with missing required columns, when ingested, then a clear error lists the missing column names.

**BKL-103: Build input/output mapping configuration for OpenFisca variable names**

- Given a YAML mapping configuration, when loaded, then OpenFisca variable names are mapped to project schema field names.
- Given a mapping with an unknown OpenFisca variable, when validated, then an error identifies the exact field name and suggests corrections.
- Given a valid mapping, when applied to adapter output, then all mapped fields are present in the result with correct values.

**BKL-104: Implement open-data ingestion pipeline (synthetic population, emission factors)**

- Given a synthetic population dataset in CSV/Parquet, when loaded through the pipeline, then data source metadata and hash are recorded.
- Given an emission factor dataset, when loaded, then factors are accessible by category and year for template computations.
- Given a corrupted or incomplete dataset, when loaded, then the pipeline fails with a specific error before any computation begins.

**BKL-105: Add data-quality checks with blocking field-level errors at adapter boundary**

- Given adapter output with a null value in a required field, when validated, then a blocking error identifies the exact field and row.
- Given adapter output with type mismatches, when validated, then each mismatch is reported with expected vs actual types.
- Given valid adapter output, when validated, then checks pass silently and computation proceeds.

**BKL-107: Create compatibility matrix for supported OpenFisca versions**

- Given the compatibility matrix, when a user queries a specific OpenFisca version, then the matrix indicates supported/unsupported status.
- Given an OpenFisca version not in the matrix, when the adapter is initialized, then a warning is emitted with a link to the matrix.

**BKL-108: Set up project scaffold, dev environment, and CI smoke pipeline**

- Given a fresh clone of the repository, when `uv sync` is run, then all dependencies install and `pytest` runs successfully.
- Given a push to the repository, when CI triggers, then lint (ruff) and unit tests execute and report pass/fail.
- Given the project directory structure, when inspected, then it matches the architecture subsystem layout.

| BKL-207 | Story | P0 | 5 | Implement YAML/JSON workflow configuration with schema validation | done | FR31, NFR4, NFR20 |

### Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria

- Analysts can create baseline/reform scenarios from templates without code changes.
- Registry stores versioned scenario snapshots.
- Scenario validation enforces year-indexed schedules (>= 10 years configurable).
- Analyst can define and run a complete scenario workflow from a YAML configuration file without code changes.
- YAML schema is validated on load with field-level error messages.
- YAML configuration files are version-controlled and round-trip stable.

### Story-Level Acceptance Criteria

**BKL-201: Define scenario template schema (baseline + reform overrides)**

- Given a YAML template definition with baseline parameters, when loaded, then the schema validates required fields (policy type, year schedule, parameter values).
- Given a reform defined as parameter overrides to a baseline, when loaded, then only the overridden fields differ from baseline defaults.
- Given a template with a year schedule shorter than 10 years, when validated, then a warning is emitted (error if enforcement mode is strict).

**BKL-202: Implement carbon-tax template pack (4-5 variants)**

- Given the shipped carbon-tax template pack, when listed, then at least 4 variants are available (e.g., flat rate, progressive rate, with/without dividend).
- Given a carbon-tax template, when executed with a baseline population, then tax burden and redistribution amounts are computed per household.
- Given two carbon-tax variants, when run in batch, then comparison output shows per-decile differences.

**BKL-203: Implement subsidy/rebate/feebate template pack**

- Given the subsidy template pack, when listed, then at least subsidy, rebate, and feebate templates are available.
- Given a feebate template, when applied to a population, then households above the threshold pay and households below receive.
- Given a rebate template with income-conditioned parameters, when executed, then rebate amounts vary by income group.

**BKL-204: Build scenario registry with immutable version IDs**

- Given a scenario saved to the registry, when retrieved by version ID, then the returned definition is identical to what was saved.
- Given a saved scenario, when modified and re-saved, then a new version ID is assigned and the previous version remains accessible.
- Given an invalid version ID, when queried, then a clear error indicates the version does not exist.

**BKL-205: Implement scenario cloning and baseline/reform linking**

- Given a baseline scenario, when cloned, then the clone has a new ID and identical parameters.
- Given a reform scenario linked to a baseline, when the baseline is retrieved, then the link is navigable in both directions.
- Given a clone with modifications, when saved, then it does not alter the original scenario.

**BKL-207: Implement YAML/JSON workflow configuration with schema validation**

- Given a valid YAML workflow configuration, when loaded, then the workflow executes end-to-end (data load, scenario, run, indicators).
- Given a YAML file with an invalid field, when validated, then the error message identifies the exact line and field name.
- Given a YAML file saved and reloaded, when compared, then the content is round-trip stable (no silent changes).
- Given the shipped YAML examples, when CI runs validation, then all examples pass schema checks.

## EPIC-3: Step-Pluggable Dynamic Orchestrator and Vintage Tracking

**User outcome:** Analyst can run multi-year projections with vintage tracking and get year-by-year panel results.

**Status:** done

| ID | Type | Pri | SP | Title | Status | PRD Refs |
|------|------|-----|----|-------|--------|----------|
| BKL-301 | Story | P0 | 8 | Implement yearly loop orchestrator with step pipeline architecture | done | FR13, FR18 |

| BKL-307 | Story | P0 | 5 | Produce scenario-year panel output dataset | done | FR18, FR33 |

### Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria

- Orchestrator executes a registered pipeline of steps for each year in t..t+n.
- Steps are pluggable: vintage and carry-forward ship in Phase 1; new steps can be added without modifying orchestrator core.
- OpenFisca computation is called via ComputationAdapter at each yearly iteration.
- 10-year baseline and reform runs complete end-to-end.
- Yearly state transitions are deterministic given same inputs and seeds.
- Vintage outputs are visible per year in panel results.
- Step pipeline configuration is recorded in run manifest.

### Story-Level Acceptance Criteria

**BKL-301: Implement yearly loop orchestrator with step pipeline architecture**

- Given a scenario with a 10-year horizon, when the orchestrator runs, then it executes the step pipeline for each year from t to t+9 in order.
- Given an empty step pipeline, when the orchestrator runs, then it completes without error (no-op per year).
- Given a step that raises an error at year t+3, when the orchestrator runs, then execution halts with a clear error indicating the failing step and year.

**BKL-302: Define orchestrator step interface and step registration mechanism**

- Given a custom step implementing the step interface, when registered with the orchestrator, then it is called at the correct position in the pipeline for each year.
- Given a step registered with dependencies on another step, when the pipeline is built, then steps execute in dependency order.
- Given a step with an invalid interface, when registered, then a clear error identifies the missing method or signature mismatch.

**BKL-303: Implement carry-forward step (deterministic state updates between years)**

- Given household state at year t, when carry-forward executes, then state variables are updated for year t+1 according to configured rules.
- Given identical inputs and seeds, when carry-forward runs twice, then outputs are bit-identical.
- Given no explicit period semantics in configuration, when carry-forward is configured, then validation rejects the configuration (NFR10 compliance).

**BKL-304: Implement vintage transition step for one asset class (vehicle or heating)**

- Given a vehicle fleet with age distribution at year t, when vintage transition runs, then cohorts age by one year and new vintages are added according to transition rules.
- Given identical transition rules and seeds, when run twice, then vintage state at year t+n is identical.
- Given vintage state at each year, when panel output is produced, then vintage composition is visible per year.

**BKL-305: Integrate ComputationAdapter calls into orchestrator yearly loop**

- Given a configured OpenFiscaAdapter, when the orchestrator runs year t, then the adapter's `compute()` is called with the correct population and policy for that year.
- Given a mock adapter, when the orchestrator runs, then the full yearly loop completes using mock results.
- Given an adapter that fails at year t+2, when the orchestrator runs, then the error includes the adapter version, year, and failure details.

**BKL-306: Log seed controls, step execution order, and adapter version per yearly step**

- Given an orchestrator run, when inspecting the log, then each yearly step shows the random seed used, the step execution order, and the adapter version.
- Given two runs with different seeds, when logs are compared, then the seed difference is visible in the log entries.

**BKL-307: Produce scenario-year panel output dataset**

- Given a completed 10-year run, when panel output is produced, then it contains one row per household per year with all computed fields.
- Given panel output, when exported to CSV/Parquet, then the file is readable by pandas/polars with correct types.
- Given baseline and reform runs, when panel outputs are compared, then per-household per-year differences are computable.

- Comparison outputs support side-by-side baseline/reform analysis.
- Export format is machine-readable CSV/Parquet.

### Story-Level Acceptance Criteria

**BKL-401: Implement distributional indicators by income decile**

- Given a completed scenario run with household-level results, when distributional analysis is invoked, then indicators are computed for each of the 10 income deciles.
- Given a population with missing income data for some households, when analysis runs, then those households are flagged and excluded with a count warning.

**BKL-402: Implement geographic aggregation indicators**

- Given household results with region codes, when geographic aggregation is invoked, then indicators are grouped by region.
- Given a region code not in the reference table, when aggregated, then results include an "unmatched" category with count.

**BKL-403: Implement welfare indicators (winners/losers, net changes)**

- Given baseline and reform scenario results, when welfare indicators are computed, then winner count, loser count, and net gain/loss per decile are returned.
- Given a scenario where all households are neutral (zero net change), when computed, then winner and loser counts are both zero.

**BKL-404: Implement fiscal indicators (annual and cumulative)**

- Given a multi-year scenario run, when fiscal indicators are computed, then annual revenue, cost, and balance are returned per year.
- Given a 10-year run, when cumulative fiscal indicators are requested, then they sum correctly across all years.

**BKL-405: Implement scenario comparison tables across runs**

- Given two completed scenario runs (baseline and reform), when comparison is invoked, then a side-by-side table is produced with all indicator types.
- Given comparison output, when exported to CSV/Parquet, then the file is readable with correct column headers and types.

**BKL-406: Implement custom derived indicator formulas**

- Given a user-defined formula referencing existing indicator fields, when the formula is registered and invoked, then it produces a new derived indicator column with correct values.
- Given an invalid formula (e.g., referencing a nonexistent field), when registered, then a clear error identifies the problem before computation begins.

### Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria

- Each run emits one parent manifest plus linked yearly manifests.
- Manifest includes OpenFisca adapter version, scenario version, data hashes, and seeds.
- Rerun harness demonstrates reproducibility for benchmark fixtures.

### Story-Level Acceptance Criteria

**BKL-501: Define immutable run manifest schema v1**

- Given a completed simulation run, when the manifest is generated, then it contains engine version, adapter version, scenario version, data hashes, seeds, timestamps, and parameter snapshot.
- Given a generated manifest, when any field is modified, then integrity checks detect the tampering.

**BKL-502: Capture assumptions/mappings/parameters in manifests**

- Given a run with custom mapping configuration, when the manifest is inspected, then all mappings and assumption sources are listed with their values.
- Given a run using an unvalidated template, when the manifest is generated, then a warning flag is included in the manifest metadata.

**BKL-503: Implement run lineage graph (scenario run -> yearly child runs)**

- Given a 10-year scenario run, when lineage is queried, then one parent manifest links to 10 yearly child manifests.
- Given a yearly child manifest, when its parent is queried, then the parent scenario run is returned.

**BKL-504: Hash input/output artifacts and store in manifest**

- Given input CSV/Parquet files, when hashed, then SHA-256 hashes are stored in the manifest without embedding raw data.
- Given output artifacts, when hashed, then output hashes are stored and can be verified after the run.

**BKL-505: Add reproducibility check harness for deterministic reruns**

- Given a completed run and its manifest, when the harness re-executes with the same inputs and seeds, then outputs are bit-identical.
- Given a run on a different machine (same Python and dependency versions), when re-executed, then outputs match within documented tolerances.

**BKL-506: Add warning system for unvalidated templates/configs**

- Given a scenario using a template not yet marked as validated, when a run is initiated, then a visible warning is emitted before execution proceeds.
- Given a validated template, when a run is initiated, then no warning is emitted.

| BKL-606 | Task | P1 | 3 | Improve operational error UX | done | FR4, FR27 |

### Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria

- API supports full run lifecycle from data ingest to comparison outputs.
- GUI supports baseline/reform scenario operations without code.

### Story-Level Acceptance Criteria

**BKL-601: Implement stable Python API for run orchestration**

- Given the Python API, when a user calls the run method with a scenario configuration, then a complete orchestration cycle executes and returns results.
- Given API objects (scenarios, results, manifests), when displayed in a Jupyter notebook, then sensible `__repr__` output is shown.
- Given an invalid scenario configuration, when passed to the API, then a clear error is raised before execution begins.

**BKL-602: Build quickstart notebook**

- Given a fresh install of the package, when the quickstart notebook is run cell by cell, then it completes without errors and produces distributional charts.

**BKL-603: Build advanced notebook (multi-year + vintage + comparison)**

- Given the advanced notebook, when executed, then it demonstrates a multi-year run with vintage tracking and baseline/reform comparison.
- Given the advanced notebook, when run in CI, then it passes without modification.

**BKL-604a: Build static GUI prototype**

- Given the prototype, when opened in a browser, then the analyst can navigate the full configuration and simulation flows using clickable screens.
- Given the prototype, when inspected, then it uses the target stack (React + Shadcn/ui + Tailwind) so screens are reusable in the final app.

**BKL-604b: Wire GUI prototype to FastAPI backend**

- Given the wired GUI, when an analyst creates a new scenario from a template, then no code editing is required.
- Given the wired GUI, when an analyst clones a baseline and modifies parameters, then a reform scenario is created and linked to the baseline.
- Given two completed runs in the GUI, when comparison is invoked, then side-by-side indicator tables are displayed.

**BKL-605: Add export actions in API/GUI for CSV/Parquet outputs**

- Given completed scenario results, when export to CSV is invoked, then a valid CSV file is produced with correct headers.
- Given completed scenario results, when export to Parquet is invoked, then a valid Parquet file is produced readable by pandas/polars.

### Story-Level Acceptance Criteria

**BKL-701: Verify simulation outputs against published benchmarks (100k households)**

- Given the benchmark suite and a 100k household population, when run on a standard laptop (4-core, 16GB RAM), then all benchmark tests complete and deviations are within documented tolerances.
- Given a benchmark failure, when reported, then the output identifies which metric failed, expected vs actual values, and tolerance.

**BKL-702: System warns analyst before exceeding memory limits**

- Given a population exceeding 500k households on a 16GB machine, when a run is attempted, then a clear memory warning is displayed before execution begins.

**BKL-703: Enforce CI quality gates**

- Given a pull request with failing lint checks, when CI runs, then the merge is blocked with specific lint errors listed.
- Given a pull request with test coverage below the threshold, when CI runs, then the merge is blocked with coverage report.

**BKL-704: External pilot user can run complete carbon-tax workflow**

- Given the pilot package on a clean Python environment, when installed and the example is run, then the carbon-tax workflow completes end-to-end with charts and indicators.
- Given the pilot package, when an external user follows the documentation, then they can reproduce the example results without assistance.

**BKL-705: Define Phase 1 exit checklist and pilot sign-off criteria**

- Given the exit checklist, when reviewed against completed work, then each criterion maps to a verifiable artifact or test result.

## EPIC-8: Post-Phase-1 Validation Spikes

**User outcome:** Platform developers confirm that the adapter layer works end-to-end with real OpenFisca and at production scale.

**Status:** done

Priority and SP are not assigned for post-Phase-1 spikes.

| ID | Type | Pri | SP | Title | Status | PRD Refs |
|------|------|-----|------|-------|--------|----------|
| 8-1 | Spike | — | — | End-to-end OpenFisca integration spike | done | — |
| 8-2 | Story | — | — | Scale validation: 100k synthetic population benchmarks | done | NFR1, NFR3 |

### Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria

- Adapter processes real OpenFisca-France computations end-to-end without error.
- Platform handles 100k-household populations within NFR performance targets.
- All findings and gaps are documented for follow-up in EPIC-9.

### Story-Level Acceptance Criteria

## Epic 9: OpenFisca Adapter Hardening

**User outcome:** Adapter handles real-world OpenFisca entity models, variable periodicities, and multi-entity outputs correctly.

**Status:** backlog (follow-ups from spike 8-1 findings)

### Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria

- Adapter correctly handles all OpenFisca-France entity types and variable periodicities.
- A reference test suite validates adapter output against known French tax-benefit values.

---

### Story 9.1: Fix entity-dict plural keys

**Status:** done
**Priority:** P0
**Estimate:** 1

Entity dicts use correct plural key names as expected by OpenFisca's `SimulationBuilder`.
Fixed during 8-1 code review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Entity dicts use correct plural key names as expected by OpenFisca's `SimulationBuilder`.

---

### Story 9.2: Handle multi-entity output arrays

**Status:** backlog
**Priority:** P0
**Estimate:** 5

**Dependencies:** Story 9.1

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Given output variables that return per-entity arrays (e.g., per-menage, per-foyer_fiscal), when the adapter processes results, then arrays are correctly mapped to their respective entity tables.
- Given a variable defined on `foyer_fiscal` entity, when results are returned, then the output array length matches the number of foyers fiscaux, not the number of individuals.
- Given mixed-entity output variables, when processed, then each variable's values are stored in the correct entity-level result table with proper entity IDs.

---

### Story 9.3: Add variable periodicity handling

**Status:** backlog
**Priority:** P0
**Estimate:** 5

**Dependencies:** Story 9.2

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Given variables with different periodicities (monthly, yearly), when `compute()` is called, then the adapter converts periods correctly before passing to OpenFisca.
- Given a monthly variable requested for a yearly period, when computed, then the adapter handles period conversion according to OpenFisca conventions.
- Given an invalid period format, when passed to the adapter, then a clear error identifies the expected format.

---

### Story 9.4: Define population data 4-entity format

**Status:** backlog
**Priority:** P0
**Estimate:** 8

**Dependencies:** Story 9.2

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Given the French tax-benefit model's 4 entities (individu, menage, famille, foyer_fiscal), when a population dataset is loaded, then all entity relationships are preserved and passable to `SimulationBuilder`.
- Given a population with membership arrays for all 4 entities, when built via `SimulationBuilder`, then entity group memberships are correctly assigned.
- Given a population dataset missing a required entity relationship, when loaded, then validation fails with a clear error identifying the missing relationship.

---

### Story 9.5: OpenFisca-France reference test suite

**Status:** backlog
**Priority:** P0
**Estimate:** 5

**Dependencies:** Story 9.3, Story 9.4

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a set of known French tax-benefit scenarios with published expected values, when run through the adapter, then computed values match reference values within documented tolerances.
- Given the reference test suite, when run in CI, then all tests pass and tolerance thresholds are documented.
- Given a new OpenFisca-France version, when the reference suite is run, then regressions are detected and reported.
