# Epic 17 - Code Antipatterns

## Story 17-1 (2026-03-07)

| Severity | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| critical | AC-5 validation — backend hardcodes `validation_result=None`, so no marginal check data is ever returned | Deferred — wiring `PopulationValidator` requires understanding catalog marginal API; added as AI-Review follow-up |
| critical | AC-5 distributions — `PopulationPreview` uses placeholder `100 - i * 8` values, not real population statistics | Deferred — explicitly commented "not in scope for 17.1"; added as AI-Review follow-up |
| high | `<a>` nested inside `<button>` — HTML spec violation; browsers handle nested interactive elements inconsistently | Restructured card to `<div>` wrapper with `<button>` for selection and sibling `<a>` for the link |
| high | AC-2 VariableOverlapView — overlap table not implemented, shows static text; `hasKnownOverlap = false` hardcoded | Deferred — explicitly documented design decision in Dev Agent Record; added as AI-Review follow-up |
| medium | `list_sources` broad `except Exception` silently drops datasets without loud failure | Changed to `except (AttributeError, KeyError)` with ERROR-level logging — prevents masking programming errors while being resilient to individually malformed catalog entries |
| medium | Task 1.3 column schema contract — `ColumnInfo` missing `type` field; task specifies `(name, type, description)` | Added `type: str = ""` to backend `ColumnInfo`; added `type: string` to frontend `ColumnInfo` interface |
| medium | Determinism test only asserts `record_count` equality on a fully mocked pipeline; proves nothing about reproducibility | Deferred — mock design is intentional; fixing properly requires a content-hash assertion; added as AI-Review follow-up |
| low | AC-1 — `record_count` always `None` in source listing; card conditionally hides the badge | Deferred — catalog metadata doesn't expose record counts without loading data; added as AI-Review follow-up |

## Story 17-2 (2026-03-07)

| Severity | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| critical | Delete endpoint fails-open — if `get_entry_type` raises an exception, `entry_type` defaults to `"portfolio"` and `shutil.rmtree` proceeds, potentially deleting non-portfolio entries | Changed fallback to `entry_type = "unknown"` so the `entry_type != "portfolio"` guard fails closed |
| high | AC-4 gap — `rate_schedule` always sent as `{}` in both `validatePortfolio` and `createPortfolio` API calls; user-edited schedule values discarded | Added `rateSchedule: Record<string, number>` to `CompositionEntry`, wired `YearScheduleEditor` into the composition panel, propagated values to API payloads |
| medium | `validate_compatibility` exception swallowed — broad `except Exception` returns empty conflicts (`is_compatible=True`), masking errors | Re-raised as `HTTPException(500)` with structured error detail |
| medium | Falsy value serialization — `if val:` drops zero-valued parameters (e.g., a `rate = 0` or empty thresholds) from detail response | Changed to `if val is not None and val != () and val != {}:` |
| medium | Bad rate_schedule year key raises unhandled 500 — `int("bad")` raises `ValueError` with no exception handler | Wrapped in `try/except ValueError` → `HTTPException(422)` |
| medium | AC-5 gap — saved portfolios list is read-only; no delete/load/clone buttons in GUI | Added delete button per portfolio row; wired `deletePortfolio` API call with toast feedback; load/clone deferred (see action items) |
| low | AC-2 gap — `parameterSchemas` prop exists in `PortfolioCompositionPanel` but is never populated by `PortfolioDesignerScreen`; ParameterRow editing non-functional | Deferred (requires fetching `GET /api/templates/{id}` per template; added as action item). `YearScheduleEditor` now always shown in expanded panel, covering the main AC-4 use case. |

## Story 17-3 (2026-03-07)

| Severity | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| critical | Path traversal via `run_id` — `self._base_dir / run_id` in `ResultStore` accepts user-supplied run IDs from URL paths, allowing `../../etc` to escape the base directory via URL-encoded separators | Added `_resolve_safe()` using `Path.resolve()` + `relative_to()` check; added `ResultStoreError` handling (400) in all route handlers |
| critical | `DELETE /api/results/{run_id}` accepted `cache` parameter but never evicted from it (comment acknowledged the gap) | Added `ResultCache.delete()` method; called in delete route handler |
| critical | No test for simulation failure metadata path — `TestRunMetadataAutoSaveFailurePath` was missing entirely | Added `test_metadata_saved_on_simulation_exception` using `raise_server_exceptions=False` |
| high | Export callbacks in `ResultDetailView` not wired — buttons rendered but `onExportCsv`/`onExportParquet` were `undefined` in `SimulationRunnerScreen` | Imported `exportResultCsv`/`exportResultParquet`; passed as callbacks to both `ResultDetailView` instances |
| medium | Timestamp sort bug — `_parse_timestamp` returned timezone-naive `datetime.min` as fallback while all valid timestamps are timezone-aware, causing `TypeError` in `list.sort()` when any corrupt entry exists | Changed fallback to `datetime.min.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)`; added `timezone` import |

## Story 17-4 (2026-03-08)

| Severity | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| critical | CSV export vulnerable to formula injection and malformed output — no escaping for commas/quotes, no `=+-@` prefix protection | Added `escapeCsvField()` helper — prefixes formula characters with `'`, double-quotes fields containing commas/quotes/newlines |
| high | `baseline_run_id` silently ignored when not in `run_ids` instead of returning 422 | Added explicit 422 validation before duplicate check |
| high | Error contract mismatch — FastAPI serializes `HTTPException(detail={...})` as `{"detail":{...}}` but `apiFetch` checks top-level `errorBody.what`, so structured errors never reach the screen | `apiFetch` and `apiFetchBlob` now also check `rawBody.detail.what` and construct `ApiError` from nested detail |
| medium | AC-3 partial — distributional detail panel always opens with `distRows[0]`, not the clicked bar/row | Added `onBarClick` prop to `MultiRunChart`; removed wrapper div; detail panel now receives actual clicked row |
| medium | AC-4 partial — relative mode bars use series palette colors instead of sign-based emerald/red | Added `<Cell>` per bar in relative mode with emerald-500/red-500/slate-400 based on value sign |
| medium | `CrossMetricPanel` mini-ranking always sorts descending, so `min_*` criteria display worst-to-best | Added `isMin` flag; sorts ascending for `min_*`, descending for `max_*` |
| medium | Welfare tab uses generic table instead of AC-2 winner/loser/net-change summary cards | **Deferred** — domain welfare data structure must be understood before designing cards; added as AI-Review follow-up |
| low | Test coverage gap — no test for `baseline_run_id` not in `run_ids` returning 422 | Added `test_baseline_run_id_not_in_run_ids_returns_422` |
| low | "View as table" toggle missing — companion table is hardcoded visible | **Deferred** — table is functional and accessible; toggle is UX polish; added as AI-Review follow-up |
| low | `ComparisonDashboardScreen` is 764 lines (SRP concern) | **Deferred** — noted as architectural improvement; added as AI-Review follow-up |
